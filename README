  (make-snark-system)
  :

OR

(asdf::oos 'asdf::load-op 'snark)

Examples:

  (overbeek-test) in overbeek-test.lisp
    some standard theorem-proving examples, some time-consuming

  (steamroller-example) in steamroller-example.lisp
    illustrates sorts

  (front-last-example) in front-last-example.lisp
    illustrates program synthesis

  (reverse-example) in reverse-example.lisp
    illustrates logic programming style usage

A guide to SNARK has been written:

  http://www.ai.sri.com/snark/tutorial/tutorial.html

but has not been updated yet to reflect changes in SNARK,
especially for temporal and spatial reasoning.

Some other documentation issues noticed:

 - The documentation for sorts is out of sync.
  - declare-disjoint-sorts -> declare-sorts-incompatible
  - declare-subsorts -> declare-subsort (do them one at a time)
  - declare-sort-partition -> ??
  - declare-function-symbol -> declare-function
  - declare-predicate-symbol -> declare-relation
  - declare-variable-symbol -> declare-variable

Please submit an issue if you find others
